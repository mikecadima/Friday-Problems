1.Take any number n. If n is even, divide it by 2, if n is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1. Repeat the process indefinitely, and you’ll eventually reach 1.Given a num variable, can you print all the numbers in num’s Collatz sequence until 1 is reached? Print the numbers space-separated (and each test case on its own line).

2.A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 × 99.Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

3.2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from 1 to 10 without any remainder. What is the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20?
